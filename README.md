  ## Description:  
  I made this project to learn about Progressive Web Applications and how it will function offline. I learned about methods that are helpful for storing and retrieving data that is used in companies such as Google and Mozilla. 
    
  ## Installation: 
You have to install IndexedDB package which is used for an API. 
  
  ## Usage: 
  After installation requirements, it will show offline and it is able to be of use. You will deploy this full-stack application to Heroku using the Heroku Deployment Guide on The Full-Stack BlogLinks to an external site.
